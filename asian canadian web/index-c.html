		William "Bill" Gun Chong had been served in MI-9(the British Army Aid Group) from 1942 to 1945 as a spy who was called "agent 50".His tasks were mainly to transport medical supplies into the occupied area and help people who were British, commonwealth subjects, standard Allied aviators, and intelligence to escape. He always traveled by foot to avoid the attention of the Japanese army and walked 30 km a day. He dressed as a peasant and carry medical supplies in his cane. He saved countless people from the war. He has been captured by the Japanese and escaped successfully twice. Once he escaped by hiding under a fishing boat, and another time before the execution when his compatriot Spock in Japanese and displayed the business card of a Japanese officer.
