William "Bill" Gun Chong was born on July 15, 1911, in Vancouver and died in 2006. He was captured by the Japanese when he was visiting his sister in Hong Kong in 1941. He then escaped with aid from the British Army Aid Group of the British Military Intelligence Section, and served as a spy known as "agent-50". After the war, he lived on Vancouver Island and operated a cafe.
